        <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Create a GitHub account if you don't have one.</li>
            <li>Create a new repository on GitHub with the name <em>username.github.io</em>, replacing
                <em>username</em>
                with your GitHub username.
            </li>
            <li>Upload your website files (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to the repository.</li>
            <li>Make sure you have an <code>index.html</code> file in your repository; this will be the default landing
                page for your site.</li>
            <li>Go to the repository's Settings, scroll down to the GitHub Pages section, and choose the main branch as
                the source for your GitHub Pages site.</li>
            <li>GitHub will provide you with a URL (usually <em>https://username.github.io</em>) where your site will be
                hosted.</li>
            <li>Access your site using the provided URL to see your hosted website.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Recommendations:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>GitHub Pages is designed for static websites, so dynamic server-side code won't work. You'll need to use
                HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and other static assets for your site.</li>
            <li> You can use a custom domain for your GitHub Pages site, but this requires proper configuration through
                your domain registrar. DNS settings need to be updated to point to GitHub's servers.</li>
        </ul>
